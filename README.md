# Project-3
Final Project for ST558 (Fall 2020)

The following packages are needed to run the application. For ease of use, I have provided code here to both install the packages (if needed) and to call them via the library function:

install.packages("ggplot2")  
install.packages("caret")  
install.packages("readxl")  
install.packages("tidyverse")  
  
library(ggplot2)  
library(caret)  
library(readxl)  
library(tidyverse)  


The following line of code can be used to run the application:

shiny::runGitHub("Project-3", "tash088",ref="main")
